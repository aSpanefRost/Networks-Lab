the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy little black dog. But why did the fox jump when it could have used its quickness to simply run away. The answer to this question happens to be twofold; first, the fox (who was quick in terms of his wits) figured out that the dog was lazy (and little);; second and more significantly, the fox wanted to show off its abilities for the dog to admire. 

You see, the quick fox desperately needed attention and approval. Despite how little he thought of the little dog, he wanted to be seen. He remembered how his mom always used to prod him to "mingle with others" and to "face society". Spun around by the rope of her imagined words, the fox made a jump that would have put the gymnysts to shame. 

"See mom, who in the world won't absolutely love this". 

The dog. The little, human loving pile of lazy shit dog in the world did not absolutely like it. He did not dislike it much either, he just did not care. Knowing the fox to be from the line of one of his crazy ancestors who chose traditional values and the old way of life over care and comfort, the dog regarded the fox as one would an exhibit in a museum. He thought of the fox as primitive and one dimensional, like an ant, prancing around under the tyrannies its wild nature imposes on it. 

The fox knew he should not care, intellectually he knew that. He wanted to tell his imaginary mom in what he thought was his imagination to understand that he was happy without constant approval. But it seemed like she was not happy. In a moment of epiphany as he was turning his inquisitive eyes away from the dog, the fox felt like his happiness was linked to the happiness he imagined in his imaginary mother in her imaginary place and her imagined happiness, he imagined, was linked to her imaginary approval over his actions. It was like a baggage of rules to match he carried in his head, one he has been picking since the time he knew right from wrong. Perhaps the concepts of right and wrong were part of this baggage too. 

He wanted to cry. Thoughts were happening in his head at a stupidly aggressive rate, consuming more oxygen than they were worth. Somewhere in the jumble, he realized that he was feeling shitty simply because he was wired to feel that way. He saw how his neurons, seretonin, dopamine and his past had conspired against him to build this sad passage in his brain that was firing now. Signals were being produced that were making him feel bad. He was surprised how even the knowledge of these facts did not help, not one bit. Through his pain, he was forced to think who even is he. He used to think of his self as his brain and now he was forced to grapple with the possiblity that he was even smaller than that. "If I can understand something yet not control it" he thought, what right did he have of calling that something him. "I was wrong", he thought.
