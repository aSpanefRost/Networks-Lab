Rosemary
Heaven restores you in life
You're coming with me
Through the aging, the fearing, the strife
It's the smiling on the package
It's the faces in the sand
It's the thought that holds you upwards
Embracing me with two hands
Right will take you places
Yeah maybe to the beach
When your friends they do come crying
Tell them now your pleasure's set up on slow-release
Hey wait
Great smile
Sensitive to faith, not denial
But hey whose on trial?
It took a life span with no cellmate
The long way back
Sandy, why can't we look the other way?
We speaks about travel
Yeah, we think about the land
We smart like all peoples
Feeling real tan
I can take you places
Do you need a new man?
Wipe the pollen from the faces
Make revision to a dream while you wait in the van
Hey wait
Great smile
Sensitive to faith, not denial
But hey whose on trial?
It took a life span with no cellmate
To find the long way back
Sandy, why can't we look the other way?
You're weightless, you are exotic
You need something for which to care
Sandy, why can't we look the other way?
Leave some shards under the belly
Lay some grease inside my hand
It's a sentimental jury
And the makings of a good plan
You've come to love me lightly
Yeah you've come to hold me tight
Is this motion ever lasting
Or do shudders pass in the night?
Rosemary
Oh heaven restores you in life
I spent a lifespan with no cellmate
The long way back
Sandy, why can't we look the other way?
You're weightless, semi-exotic
You need someone to take you there
Sandy, why can't we look the other way?
Why can't we just play the other game?
Why can't we just look the other way?
